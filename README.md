# Salesforce Custom Content Block SDK - Interaction Studio

## Changelog:
- v1: 	Draft with placeholder images

## Introduction:
For more information, visit: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/content-sdk.htm

Files you should edit:

- index.html
	- This is where all the action takes place. Contains the javascript, html, etc. This is the most important file to edit.

- DragIcon.png
- Icon.png
	- You must strictly follow this naming convention and use the same size as these images or MC will not show the right images in the Content Builder UI.


THIS IS JUST A MOCK UP/PROTOTYPE. IT IS NOT THE PRODUCTIZED INTERACTION STUDIO CONNECTOR NOR HOW THE CONTENT BLOCK WILL EVENTUALLY LOOK. THIS IS PURELY FOR DEMONSTRATION OF THE "ART OF THE POSSIBLE" AND SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS A PRODUCT. #SAFEHARBOR
